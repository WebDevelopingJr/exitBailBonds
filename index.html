            What You Can Expect At First Appearance <span class="icon">▶</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            (Do not confuse a defendant’s first appearance with an arraignment. In most cases, a defendant will  plead not guilty until the arraignment.)
            A defendant’s bond status can change in several ways depending on the court’s decision. If someone is arrested under a “no bond” status, a monetary bond amount may later be set. Likewise, a previously established monetary bond can be revoked, placing the defendant back under “no bond” status. The court also has the authority to raise, lower, or maintain the amount of bond. In some cases, instead of posting bond, a defendant may be placed on supervised release, which requires regular reporting to Pretrial staff and, at times, compliance with special court-ordered conditions such as random urinalysis or drug and alcohol evaluations. Additionally, defendants who have strong community ties and are not considered a threat to public safety or a flight risk may be released on their own recognizance, allowing them to return to court without any monetary obligation.

            The Truth … How Exit Bail Bonds Work <span class="icon">▶</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            If a defendant with Exit Bail Bonds cannot provide enough cash to post the entire bail amount, the court will accept a bail bond instead. In this process, an insurance company working through Exit Bail Bonds charges a premium for posting the bond. For example, if the court sets bail at $10,000, the insurance company may legally charge a 10% premium, or $1,000, to post the bond. Additionally, the company requires a guarantor to sign for the bond, meaning this individual agrees to pay the insurance company the full $10,000 if the defendant fails to appear in court.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            Miami bail bonds are regulated by the Department of Financial Services. Each and every licensed bail bond agency, including family oriented Exit Bail Bonds, charge the same fee for a bail bond. Bail Agents are strictly prohibited from charging more, or charging less for services rendered. Limited Surety Agents or Bail Agents are not cops and they do not work for the State. Their function is similar to Insurance Agents by providing a service to the public so that a family, friend, or loved one can be released from jail on an Exit Bail Bonds bond..
            <br>
            A bail bond (or surety bail bond) is a security posted by the defendant (accused) in order to ensure the accused will appear in court. Bail can be posted in cash or an Exit Bail Bonds bond.
            <br>
            Once a person is busted for a crime, the jail or Magistrate can impose a bail amount to be paid before the person can be released from custody. Either the defendant ponies up the full amount, or relies on Exit Bail Bonds to come to the rescue. You can reach us at exitbailbondsinc@gmail.com or 305-233-3000. Make the call today.

            Consideration for Obtaining Bail <span class="icon">▶</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            When determining the bond amount, a judge considers several important factors, including the severity of the crime, the likelihood that the suspect may flee, whether the suspect’s release could pose harm to others, and the suspect’s criminal history.

            What Exit Bail Bonds do, and what to expect. <span class="icon">▶</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            When Exit Bail Bonds writes a bail bond, it is to acquire a defendants release by supplying to the court a monetary fee. The fee, usually determined by a judge or a fee table, insures that a defendant appears in court. The bail bond exists so that a defendant has an opportunity to continue his life until a trial ends.
            <br><br>  
            Usually, when a person is arrested, generally he is put in custody, be it a police station or a city, county, or state holding facility, where he is booked. The defendant or suspect is interviewed, photographed, fingerprinted, and subjected to a background check. The suspect also is tested for alcohol intoxication and use of illegal substances, which may include prescription medicines. Generally, the detainee or prisoner is allowed a phone call. This is the time to phone Exit Bail Bonds.
            <br><br>
            More than likely, a suspect will appear before a judge or magistrate the next business day after the arrest. A bail hearing determines if the suspect may be released on bail. The judge will determine how much the bond will be.
            <br><br>
